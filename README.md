A new security method for re-registering password on each login request(or on-demand).

The method has to be integrated on both client and server side code.

The method mainly address cases where users share the same password across different providers (such as banking, gmail, facebook ..etc), and reduces the risk of re-using a password hacked from other service providers.

- improves client confidentiality.
- reduces risks of server side malwares revealing user password.
- makes rainbow table attacks practically impossible.
- allows the user to have significantly improved security.
