A new security method for re-registering password on each login request(or on-demand).

This method has to be integrated on both client and server side code.

This method handles cases where users share the same password across different providers (such as banking, gmail, facebook ..etc)

- improves client confidentiality.
- reduces risks of server side malwares revealing user password.
- makes rainbow table attacks practically impossible.
- allows the user to have significantly improved security.
